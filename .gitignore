# Output of `go build`
# For example, if your main package is in a directory named 'myproject',
# `go build` will create an executable named 'myproject' in the current directory.
# You might want to ignore this, or specify a dedicated 'bin/' directory.
# For example:
# myproject
# bin/

# Dependency directories (Go modules)
# These are usually handled by `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor`
# and are not typically committed to Git unless vendoring is explicitly used.
